🖥️ Windows Version Requirements
To follow this tutorial, you need:

✅ Minimum Windows Version for WSL 2

- Windows 10: Version 1903 or higher, Build 18362 or higher

- Windows 11: Any version supports WSL 2 by default

---
📝 To check your Windows version:

```powershell
winver
```

✅ Enable Virtualization

WSL 2 requires virtualization to be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI.

Most modern computers have it enabled by default. If not, enable it from your BIOS settings (usually pressing Del or F2 at startup).

✅ Admin Access Required

You must be able to run PowerShell as Administrator to install and configure WSL.
